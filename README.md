# Semantic-Passage-Retrieval

This repository contains code for performing semantic passage retrieval using pre-trained sentence embeddings and cosine similarity. It includes scripts for encoding queries and documents into fixed-dimensional embeddings using the Sentence Transformers library, calculating cosine similarities between them, and finding relevant passages based on semantic similarity. The provided examples demonstrate how to use the code for various search tasks, making it useful for applications such as document retrieval, question answering, and information extraction.
